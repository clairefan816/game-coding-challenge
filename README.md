## 📕 Background

## 🎨 Features
The MUSICMIND app is a single page / single user experience design. This code breaking game is 
deduced into three ways of playing.
* **Classic Number Guess Game** : Guess the right four-digits number within 10 rounds.
* **Rainbow Color Cubes** : The digits are mapped to corresponding fresh colors. If you're bored 
  to guess numbers, let's guess the secret color pattern.
* **On Screen Simple Piano** : For those sound masters, you will never get bored by guessing 
  sound patterns with a mini keyboard play around.
