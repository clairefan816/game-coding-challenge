## 📕 Background
### Value of this App
Why I'd like to develop this app.
The MUSICMIND app is a single page / single user experience design. 

Whom can benefit from this app.


### Game History
MusicMind app is a board / decode game adapted from an old British game called `🐂s and 🐄s`.
The idea of the game is for one player (the code-breaker) to guess the secret code chosen by the 
other player(the code-maker).  

The code is a sequence of 4 digits chosen from 0 ~ 9. Then, the code-breaker makes a serie of 
pattern guesses - after each guess the code-maker gives feedback in the form of 2 numbers. If 
the matching digits are in the right position, you earn a 🐂, if in different positions, you earn 
a 🐄.  The code-breaker wins the game by getting the secret number ( earn 4 🐂s in one round ) 
within 10 rounds.

For example:  
* Secret number: 1357  
* Opponent's try: 1538  
* Answer: 1 🐂 and 2 🐄s (The bull is "1", the cows are "2" and "5".)  

### New Features  
Following the playing rule of `🐂s and 🐄s`, MusicMind develop two more features into 
this game, 
decode the color pattern, and the sound pattern.

Users can either play with one mode or three modes:
* **Guess number pattern** :
* **Guess color pattern** :
* **Guess color pattern** :

For making this game more friendly to everyone, this app opened two difficulty level for users
to pick from :
* **Easy Level** : The secret number / color / sound pattern is picked from 8 candidates.
  It means there are `4096` possible combinations.
* **Hard Level** : The secret number / color / sound pattern is picked from 10 candidates.
  It means there are `10000` possible combinations.
