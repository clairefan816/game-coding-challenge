## 📕 Background
Mastermind is a legend board game adapted from an old British game called `🐂s and 🐄s`.
The idea of the game is for one player (the code-breaker) to guess the secret code chosen by the 
other player(the code-maker).  
The code is a sequence of 4 digits chosen from 0 ~ 9. Then, the code-breaker makes a serie of 
pattern guesses - after each guess the code-maker gives feedback in the form of 2 numbers. If 
the matching digits are in the right position, you earn a 🐂, if in different positions, you earn 
a 🐄.  

For example:  
* Secret number: 1357  
* Opponent's try: 1538  
* Answer: 1 🐂 and 2 🐄s (The bull is "1", the cows are "2" and "5".)  
  

The code-breaker who gets the secret number within 10 rounds of guess wins the game.


## 🎨 Features
The MUSICMIND app is a single page / single user experience design. This code breaking game is 
deduced into three ways of playing.
* **Classic Number Guess Game** : Guess the right four-digits number within 10 rounds.
* **Rainbow Color Cubes** : The digits are mapped to corresponding fresh colors. If you're bored 
  to guess numbers, let's guess the secret color pattern.
* **On Screen Simple Piano** : For those sound masters, you will never get bored by guessing 
  sound patterns with a mini keyboard play around.
